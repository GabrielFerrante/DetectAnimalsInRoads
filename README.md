# DetectAnimalsInRoads

Single-stage detectors for edge computing with CNN architecture to detect animals that suffer the most accidents on Brazilian highways.
Using the BRA-Dataset, a specific dataset about these animals, the detectors were trained and validated in the laboratory with edge devices for edge processing for A.I.

This project is a master's project in computer science and computational mathematics at the University of São Paulo (PPG-CCMC, ICMC-USP)
